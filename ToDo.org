From Peter's email:

Another important thing might be to use the "abstract" construct in
Agda to prevent non-desirable evaluation. For example, the definition
of And is done in terms of Sigma in the standard library. This is not
good for translation, because we want to translate And in Agda into
And in predicate logic. If And in Agda is translated into Sigma during
normalizationk, then this won't happen.

See Agda patch: don't inline definitions for COMPILED functions
