* The following symbols are hard-coded, i.e. they should not changed
  FOL equality    : ≡
  FOL conjunction : ∧
  FOL negation    : ¬
  FOL false       : ⊥

* To the paper:
** The handling of ATP stuff inside where clauses
*** The problems
*** This facilitate the writes of ATP axioms. e.g.

LTC.Examples.GCD.Extra.S≤0-elim : {A : Set}{d : D} → succ d ≤ zero → A

** The difference between predicates' definitions and functions' definitions
From Agda internal representation of clauses, both definitions are
equal, the only difference is in the type of the symbol.
