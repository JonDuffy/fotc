Change log for agda2atp

0.9.1 XXX

      * Added command-line option --non-fol which enables the
        non-FOL-translations.

      * The translation of FOL universal quantified functions,
        formulae, and propositional functions is disable by
        default. The command-line options --non-fol-function,
        --non-fol-formula and --non-fol-propositional-function were
        added for this purpose.

      * Added command-line option --unproved-conjecture-no-error.

      * Removed command-line option --unproved-conjecture-error. Now
        it is the default behavior.
