When there is a new release of an ATP, we should follow the following
procedure:

* In agda2atp, to update the documentation of src/ATP.hs with the new
  version.

* In agda2atp, to run the suite of successfull tests on agda2atp with
  the new ATP.

* In FOTC, to test all the conjectures.

* In FOTC, to test the ATPs failures in FOTC/README.agda with the new
  ATP.

* In agda2atp and FOTC, to search for comments using the old version,
  i.e. something like

  $ find -name '*.*' | xargs grep 'old version'

* To update the website.
