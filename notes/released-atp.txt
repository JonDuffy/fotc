When there is a new release of an ATP, we should follow the following
procedure:

* In agda2atp, to update the documentation of src/ATP.hs with the new
  version.

* In agda2atp, to run the suite of successfull tests on agda2atp with
  the new ATP.

* If the ATP is not a default one, to add it as an default. In FOTC,
  to test all the conjectures. Compare the results with the file
  notes/atps/conjectures/default-atps-conjectures-XXXX-XX-XX.txt.

* In FOTC, to test the ATPs failures in FOTC/README.agda with the new
  ATP.

* In FOTC, to generate the conjectures files
  (FOTC/notes/atps/conjectures/new-atp-conjectures.txt) for the new ATP.

* In FOTC, to look for regressions with the previous version of the ATP.

* To update the website.
