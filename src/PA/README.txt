Peano arithmetic
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the theory of Peano arithmetic, using three
formalizations:

* Agda postulates for the non-logical constants and the Peano's
  axioms, using Mendelson's axioms [p. 155, 1]. These axioms formalize
  the propositional equality.

* Agda postulates for the non-logical constants and the Peano's
  axioms, using axioms based on the propositional equality (see, for
  example, [p. 263, 2], [p. 28, 3])).

* Agda data types and primitive recursive functions for addition and
  multiplication.
