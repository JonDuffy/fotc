Peano arithmetic
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the theory of Peano arithmetic, using three
formalizations:

* Agda postulates for the non-logical constants and the Peano's
  axioms, using Mendelson's axioms [Mendelson, 1977, p. 155]. These
  axioms formalize the propositional equality.

* Agda postulates for the non-logical constants and the Peano's
  axioms, using axioms based on the propositional equality (see, for
  example, [Machover, 1996, p. 263], [Hájek and Pudlák, 1998, p. 28]).

* Agda data types and primitive recursive functions for addition and
  multiplication.
